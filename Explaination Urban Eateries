It is A prototype for IDT Assignment

 This will be a simplified skeleton, not a complete, fully working application.

Key Limitations:

No Backend: There is no actual backend database or API. The data is simulated with dummy data.

Simplified UI: The UI is basic and intended to illustrate the core structure rather than a polished design.

Limited Functionality: Some features described in the report (like user profiles, real-time updates) are not included in this example.

No Maps Integration: Map functionality is simulated with a basic placeholder.

Requires React Native Setup: You'll need to have React Native development tools set up to run this code.





Explanation:

Imports: Imports necessary components from React Native.

dummyData Array: This is where the "data" for your eateries is stored. In a real app, you'd get this from an API or database.

App Function:

searchText State: Manages the search input value.

filteredData: Filters the dummy data based on the searchText.

selectedItem: Used to keep track of the selected place for the detail view.

renderItem Function: Renders each eatery as a list item with a basic layout.

renderDetails Function: Renders the details of selected eatery.

UI Structure: Renders a TextInput for search, and a FlatList to display the eateries.

StyleSheet: Contains basic styling for the components.





Next Steps (For a More Complete App):

Backend Development:

Set up a Node.js/Express backend.

Create a MongoDB or Firebase database.

Develop API endpoints for fetching, adding, and updating eatery data.

Advanced UI:

Use React Native UI libraries (like React Native Paper, Native Base) for more polished UI.

Implement navigation between screens.

Add more complex components, like search filters, map integration, and user profiles.

State Management: Use a state management library (like Redux or Context API) for complex state logic.

Testing: Write unit and integration tests.

Deployment: Deploy the app to app stores.

Important Notes:

This code is a starting point. It's not intended to be production-ready.

You'll need to customize the code to meet your exact project requirements and design.

React Native development is an involved process. Be prepared to learn more as you proceed.
